# TrueCarTriangleChallenge

## Triangle assignment (Implement in Java)  
### COMPLETED

Create a program that takes as inputs 3 coordinates of triangle as points (x,y). It should be able to determine if the triangle is equilateral, acute, obtuse, right or if it&#39;s impossible to form a triangle given the points.

Implementation is open ended and you can use as many classes as necessary. Please submit the java files (and any other files that might be part of your solution)

How to run: 
I developed my solution in IntelliJ. To run solution, you may open this project in IntelliJ and run either RunTriangle or /test/TriangleTest. Triangle and Point classes are defined in their respective .java files. RunTriangle takes input from triangle.txt that has a format of 6 doubles per line (x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3). This program can determine if a triangle is a triangle, equilateral, acute, obtuse, and/or right. I implemented formulas such as the distance formula, the Pythagorean theorem, and dot product to name a view. I included an abstract Shape class with area and perimeter methods that are overridden in Triangle.java.
